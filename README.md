Designed and implemented a 4-bit synchronous up counter using Verilog HDL, suitable for integration into digital systems requiring sequential counting operations such as timers, digital clocks, or address generation in memory systems.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:
Synchronous Reset: Ensures the counter resets predictably on the rising clock edge.

Enable Signal: Allows conditional counting based on control logic.

Clocked Design: Operates on the positive edge of the input clock.

Overflow Handling: Automatically rolls over after reaching the maximum 4-bit value (4'b1111).

ðŸ§  Technical Summary:
Language: Verilog HDL

Simulation & Verification: Designed with testability in mind for simulation on tools like ModelSim, VCS, or QuestaSim.

Code Quality: Clean, synthesizable RTL following standard coding practices.

Reset Type: Synchronous Active-High Reset
